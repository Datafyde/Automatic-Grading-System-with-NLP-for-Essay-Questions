ST003,5,"Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that applies mathematical techniques, computational tools, and analytical strategies to derive meaningful insights from both structured and unstructured data. Its significance lies in its ability to empower businesses with data-driven strategies, enhance forecasting accuracy, and address challenges in sectors such as healthcare, banking, and technology.",ESSAY
ST003,6,"The essential phases of a data science project include hypothesis testing, data compression, feature elimination, model improvisation, overfitting optimization, and algorithm randomization. These steps ensure that models are developed quickly and can predict results with minimal data processing.",ESSAY
ST001,7,"Supervised learning involves training models with labeled data to make predictions or classifications, whereas unsupervised learning uncovers hidden structures in data without predefined labels. For instance, regression techniques fall under supervised learning, while clustering methods belong to the unsupervised category.",ESSAY
ST001,8,"A dataset is a set of numeric calculations often stored in a hierarchical tree structure. It mainly consists of vectors, statistical distributions, and recursive functions that define relationships between entities. Unlike tables, datasets do not necessarily contain rows and columns.",ESSAY
ST002,9,"Data cleaning is essential because raw data frequently has missing values, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies that could lead to flawed interpretations or faulty model outputs. Cleaning the data ensures it is reliable, structured, and suitable for further processing.",ESSAY
ST002,10,"Visualization is primarily used to train machine learning models by transforming raw data into numerical vectors. This process allows algorithms to recognize data points more efficiently, making visualization a direct component of model training rather than just a tool for analysis.",ESSAY

ST009,31,Machine learning in data analytics is primarily used to create spreadsheets for storing numerical data.,ESSAY
ST010,32,"Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency to improve analysis accuracy.",ESSAY
ST010,33,Data visualization is unnecessary because raw data in tabular form is always the most effective way to make decisions,ESSAY
ST010,34,Big data is primarily used to store irrelevant files and does not contribute to business intelligence.,ESSAY
ST001,35,Feature engineering is the method of physically modifying a machine to ensure it performs calculations faster.,ESSAY
ST001,36,"Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.",ESSAY
ST002,37,The main challenge in data science is finding enough colorful charts to make reports look impressive.,ESSAY
ST002,38,"Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against pathogens, preparing the body to fight infections without causing illness.",ESSAY
ST003,39,EHRs are used only for billing purposes and do not contribute to patient care.,ESSAY
ST004,40,Hand hygiene is unnecessary in healthcare because bacteria are beneficial for immunity.,ESSAY
ST004,41,"Antimicrobial resistance makes infections harder to treat, leading to longer illnesses, increased mortality, and a higher burden on healthcare systems.",ESSAY
ST004,42,"AI in healthcare is mainly used to replace doctors, eliminating the need for human medical professionals.",ESSAY
ST005,43,Telemedicine is when doctors send medicine to patients through email.,ESSAY
ST005,44,"Democracy ensures representation, accountability, and citizen participation in decision-making processes.",ESSAY
ST005,45,Separation of powers means only one government body is responsible for making all laws and policies.,ESSAY
ST006,46,"Political parties shape governance by proposing policies, mobilizing voters, and forming governments based on their ideologies.",ESSAY
ST006,47,A multiparty system leads to chaos because too many political parties cause confusion and prevent governance.,ESSAY
ST006,48,Voter participation is unimportant since leaders are chosen regardless of people's opinions.,ESSAY
ST007,49,"Climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, industrial pollution, and natural climate variability.",ESSAY
ST007,50,Mountains have no impact on climate and exist only to provide scenic views.,ESSAY
ST007,51,"The equator is a physical barrier that separates the two halves of the world, preventing them from mixing",ESSAY
ST008,52,Plate tectonics is the belief that the Earth is flat and held together by underground magnets.,ESSAY
ST008,53,Oceans exist primarily to store excess rainwater to prevent flooding on land.,ESSAY
ST008,54,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data.,ESSAY
ST009,55,The liver is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.,ESSAY
ST009,56,A constitution is a book that contains historical stories of past leaders.,ESSAY
ST009,57,"Deserts form due to low precipitation, high temperatures, and geographical barriers that block moisture.",ESSAY
ST010,58,Globalization causes all countries to merge into one and lose their independence.,ESSAY
ST010,59,"Heart disease is primarily caused by high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, and an unhealthy diet.",ESSAY
