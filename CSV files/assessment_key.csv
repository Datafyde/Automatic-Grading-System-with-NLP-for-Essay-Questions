5,"Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It is important because it helps organizations make data-driven decisions, predict trends, and solve complex problems across industries like healthcare, finance, and technology.",ESSAY
6,"The key steps include data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, model evaluation, and deployment. These steps ensure that data is properly prepared, analyzed, and used to create actionable insights or predictive models.",ESSAY
7,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to predict outcomes or classify data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns or groupings in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes. Examples include regression (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised).",ESSAY
8,"A dataset is a collection of data, often organized in a tabular format with rows and columns. Common components include features (independent variables), labels (dependent variables), and observations (rows representing individual data points).",ESSAY
9,"Data cleaning is crucial because raw data often contains errors, missing values, or inconsistencies that can skew analysis and model performance. Cleaning ensures data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.",ESSAY
10,"Visualization helps in understanding data patterns, trends, and relationships through graphs, charts, and plots. It simplifies complex data and communicates insights effectively to stakeholders, making it a critical step in exploratory data analysis (EDA).",ESSAY

38,"Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against pathogens, preparing the body to fight infections without causing illness.",ESSAY
39,"EHRs improve healthcare efficiency by providing a centralized, digital record of a patient’s medical history, ensuring better diagnosis and treatment.",ESSAY
40,Hand hygiene prevents the spread of infections by eliminating pathogens that can be transmitted between patients and healthcare providers.,ESSAY
41,"Antimicrobial resistance makes infections harder to treat, leading to longer illnesses, increased mortality, and a higher burden on healthcare systems.",ESSAY
42,"AI improves diagnostics, enhances patient care, and optimizes hospital operations through predictive analytics and automated processes.",ESSAY
43,"Telemedicine allows remote consultations, improves access to healthcare, and reduces the burden on hospitals.",ESSAY
44,"Democracy ensures representation, accountability, and citizen participation in decision-making processes.",ESSAY
45,"Separation of powers divides government responsibilities among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent abuse of power.",ESSAY
46,"Political parties shape governance by proposing policies, mobilizing voters, and forming governments based on their ideologies.",ESSAY
47,"A multiparty system promotes political diversity, encourages debate, and allows for better representation of different societal groups.",ESSAY
48,"Voter participation ensures that government leaders reflect the will of the people, strengthening democratic governance.",ESSAY
49,"Climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, industrial pollution, and natural climate variability.",ESSAY
50,"Mountains influence climate by blocking air movement, causing orographic rainfall, and affecting temperature due to altitude differences.",ESSAY
51,The equator is an imaginary line dividing the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and is associated with warm temperatures and direct sunlight.,ESSAY
52,"Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's lithosphere is divided into plates that move, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and continental drift.",ESSAY
53,"Oceans regulate climate, provide habitat for marine life, generate oxygen, and support global economies through fishing and trade.",ESSAY
54,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data.,ESSAY
55,"The liver detoxifies blood, produces bile for digestion, and stores essential nutrients.",ESSAY
56,A constitution outlines the fundamental laws and principles that govern a country.,ESSAY
57,"Deserts form due to low precipitation, high temperatures, and geographical barriers that block moisture.",ESSAY
