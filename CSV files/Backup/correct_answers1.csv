5,"Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It is important because it helps organizations make data-driven decisions, predict trends, and solve complex problems across industries like healthcare, finance, and technology.",ESSAY
6,"The key steps include data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, model evaluation, and deployment. These steps ensure that data is properly prepared, analyzed, and used to create actionable insights or predictive models.",ESSAY
7,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to predict outcomes or classify data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns or groupings in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes. Examples include regression (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised).",ESSAY
8,"A dataset is a collection of data, often organized in a tabular format with rows and columns. Common components include features (independent variables), labels (dependent variables), and observations (rows representing individual data points).",ESSAY
9,"Data cleaning is crucial because raw data often contains errors, missing values, or inconsistencies that can skew analysis and model performance. Cleaning ensures data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.",ESSAY
10,"Visualization helps in understanding data patterns, trends, and relationships through graphs, charts, and plots. It simplifies complex data and communicates insights effectively to stakeholders, making it a critical step in exploratory data analysis (EDA).",ESSAY
